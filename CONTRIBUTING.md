# Contributing to the module

It's great to see modules develop further and progress, if you have any contributions please read below on how to make these.

### Quick guide to contributing to the module
*__New features or Bug Fixes__. Please fork the project and submit a GitHub pull request (It is very important that you thoroughly test the code before submitting pull requests).
*__Provide Translations__. We want to see our modules help as many people as possible, so this will allow people speaking other languages to use this.

## Development Guidelines
We try to match [SilverStripe's guidelines](http://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/)
as closely as possible. In some ways our approach will differ, but it is a good idea to read their guidelines first.
